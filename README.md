# Deceiver's Offering: A Discord Bot Deception Game

Status: FINISHED 
###### (with possible modifications in the future, including different roles that can give more points by doing a certain action)

Grifter's Gift is a Discord Bot game that can be played on Discord with players ranging from 2 players to the entire Discord server!

The game is a simple deception game with the main goal being getting as many points possible without dying. When death occurs, it will be permanent!

## Here are the Basic Rules of the Game:
  1. Every few minutes, you may visit other players and act as the guest

  2. The player you visited will act as the host

  3. The host will have the option to give the guest a nice gift or a devious gift and this will be kept a secret

  4. After receiving a gift, the guest can unbox, decline or trash the gift
      Unboxing a nice gift: The guest will gain 1 point and 1 trashability
      Unboxing a devious gift: The guest will DIE and the host will gain 1 point

      Declining a nice gift: The host will gain 1 point
      Declining a devious gift: The host will DIE and the guest will gain 1 point

      Thrashing ANY gift: The gift is forever GONE; the gift type will be revealed 
        - Trashing a gift will use up 1 trashability

  5. If a player visits you, they will act as the guest, and you will act as the host
    
Note:
  - You can only visit and get visited by one player at a time
  - You can't visit anyone while a gift has not been unboxed, declined or trashed
